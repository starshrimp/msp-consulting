**MSP CONSULTING MEYER-STEIGMEIER stands for competence, discretion, and Swiss reliability.**

We do not see ourselves as a large, anonymous agency, but as your personal representative in Switzerland. Our focus is on providing individual support to private individuals and companies who do not wish to navigate the Swiss administration alone.

Our philosophy is simple: We handle the bureaucracy so that you can focus on what matters most. We know the laws, the channels, and—often even more importantly—the contact persons at the authorities.

My background provides you with a decisive advantage: prior to founding my consultancy, I spent over a decade in senior leadership roles "on the other side"—including serving as the **Director of the Cantonal Migration Office in Zug**. This profound understanding of internal administrative structures and decision-making processes is the foundation of my clients' success today.

**Background & Expertise:**

* **Influence:** Former Board Member of the Swiss Association of Cantonal Migration Officers.
* **Track Record:** Over 25 years of successful leadership at MSP Consulting.

Thanks to my many years of experience in the administrative and immigration law sector, I know the challenges that newcomers and international companies face firsthand. I attach great importance to pragmatic solutions and open, direct communication.

**My Focus Areas:**
* Strategic advice on settlements
* Complex permit procedures
* Networking with decision-makers

> "Every case is unique. That is why I do not offer standard solutions, but strategies tailored to your specific situation."
