Switzerland offers political stability, a strong currency, and a business-friendly environment. We support you in establishing your company here in a legally secure manner.

# Legal Forms

Choosing between a GmbH (LLC) and an AG (Ltd) is the first major decision.

| Feature | GmbH (Limited Liability Company) | AG (Corporation / Ltd) |
| ------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Min. Capital** | CHF 20,000 | CHF 100,000 (min. 50% paid up) |
| **Anonymity** | Shareholders are public in the commercial register | Shareholders are generally not public |
| **Liability** | Company assets only | Company assets only |

## Our Approach

We handle the project management for your settlement:

1.  **Domiciliation:** We find suitable office space or offer domicile addresses.
2.  **Notarial Support:** Organization of the incorporation meeting and notarial certification.
3.  **Authorities:** Registration for Value Added Tax (VAT) and social security (AHV/IV).

> **Note:** Foreign companies often require a director or manager resident in Switzerland. We advise you on these requirements.
