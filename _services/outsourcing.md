## The Workflow

We integrate seamlessly into your existing processes.

1.  **Data Collection:** You send us the candidate's data.
2.  **Review:** We check the chances of approval (quotas, priority of domestic workers).
3.  **Submission:** We prepare the applications and communicate with the authorities.
4.  **Decision:** You receive the finalized permit.

### Third States vs. EU/EFTA

> **Attention:** For nationals from third states (Non-EU), the hurdles are significantly higher. It must often be proven that no domestic employee could be found.

We prepare the necessary **labor market analyses** and letters of justification for the Office for Economy and Labor.
